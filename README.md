## Intro
The words 'bóc thăm' in Vietnamese means to draw a ballot, like picking a name out of a hat.

This would solve a lot of issues at home for me; I have small children who rarely agree on anything; which movie to watch; where to eat; which game to play; well, you get the idea.

Since I am trying to learn Rust, this is a good opportunity to write this tiny program to randomly pick one of the choices from the children.

## Disclaimer
I am not a real programmer, so be ware of potential mistakes.

## Usage
Can't agree on which movies to watch?
```bash
$ cargo run
Enter the choices (comma separated):
Moana, Mario, Mufasa, Sonic

Mario was chosen.
```

Can't agree on where to eat?
```bash
$ cargo run
Enter the choices (comma separated):
McDonald, Panera, Domino, Popeye

Panera was chosen.
```
