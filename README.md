## Intro
The words 'bóc thăm' in Vietnamese means to draw a ballot, like picking a name out of a hat.

This solves a lot of issues at home for me and since I am trying to learn Rust, this is a good opportunity to write this tiny program.

## Disclaimer
I am not a real programmer, so be ware of potential mistakes.
